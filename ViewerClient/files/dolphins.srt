1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
(dolphins splashing)

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,350
- [Narrator] Of all the
relationships found in the ocean,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,813
few can beat the spinner dolphins.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,040
As well as gathering in huge numbers,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,335
they are the acrobats
of the dolphin world.

6
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:17,418
(dolphins splashing)

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,860
They can leap over 10 feet high

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,519
and spin seven times in a jump.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,714
(dolphin splashes)

10
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:30,631
(dolphin whirling)

11
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,090
(dolphin splashes)

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,763
Today, they're on a hunting expedition.

13
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,580
(dolphin splashes)

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,093
Spy Dolphin is here to find
out how they work as a team.

15
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:48,319
(water splashes)
(dolphin whistles)

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,063
Their bubbles provide a clue.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,380
On closer inspection,

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,680
they plainly come from
the dolphins blowholes.

19
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,270
(dolphins whistling)

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,322
A sign they are whistling to each other.

21
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:06,405
(dolphins whistling)

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,142
They use these calls to
bring the pod together.

23
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:14,310
(dolphins whistling)

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,853
They also have a unique whistle
to announce who they are.

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,442
The dolphin equivalent of a name.

26
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,717
(dolphin squeaking)
(water bubbles)

27
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:28,717
(dolphins whistling)

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,780
As well as whistles,

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,333
they use clicks to communicate too.

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,890
Some clicks are ultrasonic,

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,963
far above our hearing range.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,020
All this works at close range,

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,390
but to contact dolphins far away,

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,272
they use their corkscrew leaping.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,370
For an aerial view of what's going on,

36
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,203
Spy Frigate films from above.

37
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,036
(water splashing)

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,819
The leaps can be seen by distant dolphins,

39
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,819
(dolphin splashing)

40
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,539
while the splashing can be
heard from far and wide.

41
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:19,539
(dolphins whistling)

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,092
United, they can hunt as a super team.

43
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:26,880
(dolphins whistling)

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,380
Our spy is in the midst of
an extraordinary gathering:

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,539
One of the greatest mega pods ever filmed.

46
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,539
(dolphins whistling)

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,943
Spy Dolphin is here to witness
this astonishing moment.
